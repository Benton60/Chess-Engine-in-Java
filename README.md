This is a simple chess engine implemented in java. It plays on chess.com when you have the window open but you will have to tweak some of the settings to fit your displays resolution.
If you want more information on how to get it running you can contact me through github.
It works using a 2D array so it's not super fast but it was still a fun project to build.
